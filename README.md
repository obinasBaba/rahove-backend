# rahove-backend test project

## Context


Build a graphql API based on [this SDL](./schema.graphql) 

### Functionality

- The API should follow typical Graphql API design pattern.
- The data should be saved in the DB.
- Provide proper API documentation.
- Proper error handling should be used.


## What We Care About

Use any libraries that you would normally use if this were a real production App. Please note: we're interested in your code & the way you solve the problem, not how well you can use a particular library or feature.

_We're interested in your method and how you approach the problem just as much as we're interested in the end result._

Here's what you should strive for:

- Good use of current Node.js & API design best practices.
- Solid testing approach.
- Extensible code.
